# 🚀 AppHaven – A Developer-Centric App Store

**AppHaven** is an independent app store made *by developers, for developers*. It allows creators to publish their apps freely — outside of traditional platforms like the **Play Store** or **App Store** — and make them available for **free or paid** downloads.

## 🧩 Why AppHaven?

Most mainstream app stores come with strict policies, fees, and long approval times. AppHaven is built to:

- 💡 Give **developers full control** over how they distribute their apps
- 🎯 Let users **download apps directly**, without store restrictions
- 💰 Allow **paid and free apps** without high platform fees
- 🛠️ Offer a **clean, customizable, and open platform**
